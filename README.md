Hi, here's Vadim Reshetnikov
- Father
- Fullstack JS Developer
- Musician

My main interest is to solve people pains in process systems by:
- Automation
- Optimization
- Design and integrate systems and processes

I experienced in:
- Websites on React/Express/Mongo
- React-Native apps
- Node.js backend
- Cloud platforms (mostly Google Cloud)
- Run MVP projects
- Maintain and support highload projects
- Project and team management
- Write small scripts/apps to solve friend's problem on work =)

Some of projects I have participated:
- https://www.trusty.care/ - Junior Fullstack Dev (2018)
- https://www.wedyapp.com/ - Mobile App MVP Team Lead (2019)
- https://brightdata.com/ - Developer and Team Leader (working now) (since 2020)
- https://lookap.ru/ - CTO and co-founder (since 2020)

Of course, some of the project wasn't ever released or already died, but it was really fun experience in:
- Build a mobile app for sellers in cannabis shops
- Run a platform for sentiment analysis in a corporate Slack/another messenger
- Write a tool for JS static analysis (WIP as pet-project)

I don't really do something for open-source just because I prefer to spend my efforts on job or commercial projects.
So I'm not sure what useful you can find here. 

But I'll try at least show here my small pet-projects and tools.
